This project was made with the aim of validating the “Deep Learning” block of the RNCP “Designer-Developer in data science” level 6certification.

This project aims to develop an automated spam detection system based on messages gathered and shared by the telecommunications company AT&T. To accomplish this, we test and assess the performance of different deep learning models. These models are designed to comprehend the overall meaning of the text or recognize patterns, thereby determining whether each provided message is spam or not.
